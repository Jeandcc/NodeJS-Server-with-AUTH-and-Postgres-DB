# NodeJS Server with AUTH and Postgres DB

The scope of this project is to produce an Elemental server in sync with a **Postgres Database** and capable of performing autentication of the type **JWT**(JSON Web Token).

This is a project that is going to serve as a basis to the GoBarber web & app application. This is the [challenge #2](https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamp-gostack-desafio-02/blob/master/README.md#desafio-02-iniciando-aplica%C3%A7%C3%A3o) presented to the students of RocketSeat **OMNI STACK**  bootcamp.

## Initial structure

The basic server structure will be imported from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Jeandcc/Elemental-NodeJS-Server).

 ## 1. Setting up Prettier + ESLint + Sucrase
 
 These softwares will be responsible for formatting the code according to a standard (Airbnb), check for typos and process new syntaxes as "import".
